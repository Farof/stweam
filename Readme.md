# Tweb

Tweb will be (if I finish this goddamn project...) a power user twitter client.

I've been frustrated using several twitter apps not being able to control as I wished my tweets stream(s), how to populate them, filter / agregate them, display them, and act on various events. This app goal is to do just that.

For my personal use, I currently target only Firefox nightly builds, as a fully local application. If things go well, I'll support other modern browsers, and add a server for synchronisation purpose. That being said, it should work fine on Chrome.

The name "Tweb" is only a temporary project name, subject to change.
